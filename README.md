# Hill Climb Racing Autoplay using Computer Vision ðŸš—ðŸ¤–

Welcome to the Hill Climb Racing OpenCV project! This project harnesses the power of computer vision and OpenCV to create an intelligent system capable of autonomously playing the popular mobile game, "Hill Climb Racing."

## Project Highlights

- **OpenCV Integration:** Utilized OpenCV for real-time image processing, enabling the system to analyze the game screen and extract relevant features.

- **Adaptive Algorithm:** Engineered an adaptive algorithm for strategic gameplay, enabling the system to make intelligent decisions in response to dynamic terrains and unexpected obstacles.

- **Consistent Performance:** Achieved consistently high scores and demonstrated adaptability in diverse in-game scenarios.

## How it Works

1. **Image Processing:** The system captures and processes real-time screenshots of the game using OpenCV.
  
2. **Feature Extraction:** Relevant features such as terrain type, vehicle position, and obstacles are extracted from the processed images.

3. **Decision-Making:** The adaptive algorithm interprets the extracted features to make strategic decisions for optimal gameplay.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [repository_url]
   cd OpenCVGaming
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Autoplay Script:**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
